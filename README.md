For this assignment, I would say that I focus on keeping my code simple and well-organized to make it easy to read and update. For example, in Project One, I created a Python module for handling CRUD operations. This approach allowed me to connect the dashboard widgets to the database without repeating code. It saved me time and reduced the chance of errors. If I reuse this module in future projects—like for game development, it’ll be quicker to implement systems for things like saving game progress or handling player data. Having clean, adaptable code is a huge time-saver, especially as projects grow in complexity.

Whenever I’m faced with a problem, I break it down into smaller tasks and focus on understanding the requirements first. When I worked on the Grazioso Salvare project, I spent time figuring out how the database and dashboard needed to interact, which was a bit different from past assignments. It made me think more about the bigger picture and how each part of the system would work together. In the future, especially when developing games, I’d take a similar approach—understanding the game mechanics, mapping out how different systems like physics or inventory management will interact, and then tackling each problem step by step. Having a clear roadmap before diving into coding is key for me.

In the Grazioso Salvare project, I built a system that made managing and displaying data more efficient. This same kind of work applies directly to game development. For example, I’d create systems that track player progress or control how the game world changes based on player choices. This is important because players expect smooth, engaging experiences. If I didn’t focus on creating solid systems, games would struggle to maintain player interest. The skills I’m learning now, like how to manage and structure data, will help me build games that are both fun and functional.
