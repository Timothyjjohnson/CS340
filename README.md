At the start of this course, I was pretty new to writing code that could be reused and built on. I used to just write whatever worked without thinking about how I’d use it later. But through this course, I learned how to make my code more maintainable and adaptable. The CRUD Python module from Project One was a perfect example—I built it once, and then in Project Two, I connected it to the dashboard widgets instead of rewriting everything. This made things way cleaner and easier to manage. Now I see how important it is to structure my code properly so I can reuse it in future projects, like if I ever need another database-driven app.

With the Grazioso Salvare project, I had to actually break things down first. I looked at what data needed to be stored, how the dashboard would use it, and the best way to connect everything without making a mess. In past assignments, I was more focused on just getting things to work, but this time, I had to think about keeping it clean and reusable. Moving forward, I’d definitely spend more time mapping out the database structure first so it’s easier to update and scale for future needs.

Computer scientists solve problems with technology, and I’ve realized through this course that it’s not just about writing code, it’s about making things work better for real people. With the Grazioso Salvare project, my work helped organize important data so the company could access what they needed quickly. Before this course, I didn’t think much about how software impacts a business, but now I see how a well built system can save time and reduce mistakes. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, that could mean faster rescues and better care for animals. Being able to build something useful like that makes all the problem-solving worth it.
